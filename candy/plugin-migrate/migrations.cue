// migrations.cue — the declarative migration table: the DATA the `charly migrate`
// engine interprets (embedded via //go:embed in engine.go). Each entry is validated
// at process start against #Migration (schema/migration.cue, beside this file in the
// plugin). Both the table DATA and the #Migration schema live HERE in
// candy/plugin-migrate, OUTSIDE the sdk schema, so neither enters the spec codegen /
// vocab concatenation — engine data + a plugin-only validation schema, not ingress.
//
// At the current migration-baseline reset the table is EMPTY: no config below the
// current schema HEAD is migratable (`charly migrate` stamps a current-format
// config to HEAD and refuses anything below #SchemaFloor). Add a future migration
// by appending ONE entry here and bumping #SchemaVersion in
// sdk/schema/version.cue, then `task cue:gen`. Common ops need zero new Go:
//
//   migrations: [
//     {version: "2026.200.0800", name: "widget-rename",
//      ops: [{op: "rename_key", from: "widget", to: "gadget", scope: "any"}]},
//   ]
//
// A structural reshape the ops can't express sets `apply: "<hook>"` and registers
// one Go hook in goHooks. See /charly-build:migrate.
